# React JS Boilerplate

* React JS setup for quick starting the project using <code>react 16.4.*</code>, <code>redux 4.*</code> and <code>webpack 4.*</code>

### Clone repository for getting started in your working directory-
```
git clone https://github.com/akhtar-husain/React-Boilerplate.git
```

### Change directory to the working directory and type-
``` 
npm install
```

### To start dev server, run-
``` 
npm start
```

### To generate build, run-

This will create a public directory which contains all the required scripts and assets to execute the project on server.

# React JS Boilerplate

* React JS setup for quick starting the project using [React JS 16.4.*](https://reactjs.org), [Redux 4.*](https://redux.js.org/) and [webpack 4.*](https://webpack.js.org/)

### Clone repository for getting started in your working directory-
```
git clone https://github.com/akhtar-husain/React-Boilerplate.git
```

### Change directory to the working directory and run following command-
``` 
npm install
```

### To start dev server, run following command-
``` 
npm start
```

### To generate build, run following command-
``` 
npm run build
```
This will create a public directory which contains all the required scripts and assets to execute the project on server.
